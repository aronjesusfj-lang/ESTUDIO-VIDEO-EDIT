## What it does

1. **Upload a video or audio** — drag & drop or browse. Supports MP4, MOV, WebM, MKV, MP3, WAV, and OGG.
2. **Configure languages** — pick the audio language (or auto-detect) and the subtitle language.
3. **Generate subtitles** — Whisper transcribes the audio; NLLB translates when needed.
4. **Edit in the timeline** — fix text, timing, and styling with undo/redo.
5. **Export** — download an `.srt` file or a new video with burned-in captions (video files only).

Everything runs client-side. Your files never leave your device.

## Features

- **AI transcription** — [Whisper](https://huggingface.co/Xenova/whisper-base) via [transformers.js](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js), with optional WebGPU acceleration.
- **AI translation** — [NLLB-200](https://huggingface.co/Xenova/nllb-200-distilled-600M) for multilingual subtitle tracks.
- **Subtitle editor** — segment list, timeline scrubbing, multi-language tracks, caption presets (font, color, background, outline, position).
- **Export options**
  - `.srt` subtitle file
  - MP4 with hard-coded subtitles (WebCodecs + [mediabunny](https://github.com/Vanilagy/mediabunny) when available; canvas + MediaRecorder as fallback)
- **Internationalization** — English (default) and Spanish, with static pages per locale.
- **Offline-friendly models** — AI weights are downloaded once and cached in the browser (IndexedDB).
- **Audio-only mode** — upload MP3, WAV, or OGG files to generate subtitle files without needing video.

## Tech stack

| Layer | Technology |
| --- | --- |
| Framework | [Astro 6](https://astro.build) (static site) |
| Styling | [Tailwind CSS 4](https://tailwindcss.com) |
| Speech recognition | [@xenova/transformers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@xenova/transformers) (Whisper) |
| Translation | transformers.js (NLLB-200) |
| Audio extraction | [@ffmpeg/ffmpeg](https://ffmpegwasm.netlify.app) (WASM) |
| Video export | [mediabunny](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mediabunny) + WebCodecs |
| Deployment | [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com) (static assets) |

## Requirements

- **Node.js** ≥ 22.12.0
- **pnpm** (recommended package manager for this repo)

For end users, a modern Chromium-based browser (Chrome, Edge, Brave) or Firefox is recommended. Safari works but WebCodecs export may fall back to the slower MediaRecorder path.

## Getting started

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/midudev/subvid.app.git
cd subvid.app

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start the dev server (http://localhost:4321)
pnpm dev
```

On macOS versions older than 13.5, Cloudflare's local Workers runtime cannot start. Run the browser-only local app with `SUBVID_LOCAL_DEV=1 pnpm dev`; it skips the Workers adapter and does not affect production builds. The first transcription/translation downloads the selected model weights to the browser cache.

On the supplied Mac, double-click `launch-subvid.command` (or the `ESTUDIO VIDEO EDIT.command` alias on the Desktop) to start local development and open the app in the browser.

## Batch processing

The upload screen accepts multiple media files. Choose the speech model, optional translation model and target language, output type, video format, and optional MP4 audio normalization, then start the queue. The queue processes one file at a time, reports per-file errors, supports retry/cancel, and saves the selected settings as a local template. Processed subtitles are downloaded as SRT; selecting “Video + SRT” also exports a subtitled video.

For an unattended folder workflow, install FFmpeg on the machine and use the CLI:

```sh
pnpm batch -- --input ./videos --output ./subtitles --model tiny --language es --watch
```

The CLI accepts `--model tiny|base|small`, `--language es` to force speech recognition language, and optional `--translate-to es` with `--source-language en` when automatic source-language detection is unavailable. Translation uses NLLB-200. Media is decoded and processed locally; model weights are downloaded once to `~/.cache/subvid/models`. Existing output files are preserved and new runs get a numbered filename.

The editor also supports adding subtitle cues and independent text overlays, splitting/merging transcript lines, optional alignment to nearby speech edges, custom style presets, vertical/square framing, horizontal crop, watermark text, and deterministic subtitle review hints. Speech-edge alignment is a timing aid and should be reviewed for music or noisy audio.

## Scripts

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `pnpm dev` | Start Astro dev server at `localhost:4321` |
| `pnpm build` | Build the production site to `./dist/` |
| `pnpm preview` | Preview the production build locally |
| `pnpm preview:cf` | Build and preview with Wrangler (Cloudflare Workers runtime) |
| `pnpm deploy` | Build and deploy to Cloudflare Workers |
| `pnpm batch -- [options]` | Transcribe a folder locally; see Batch processing above |

## Project structure

```text
src/
├── components/       # Astro UI (upload, config, editor, export modal, …)
├── i18n/ui.ts        # Translations (en, es) — server + client strings
├── layouts/          # HTML shell, hreflang, meta tags
├── pages/            # Routes: / (en), /es/ (es)

│   └── dom.ts        # DOM helpers
└── styles/           # Global and app-specific CSS
```

The app is a multi-stage SPA embedded in static Astro pages. Server-rendered copy lives in `src/i18n/ui.ts`; runtime strings for the active locale are injected into `window.__I18N__` so only one language ships per page.

## Architecture notes

- **Main thread** — UI, video playback, timeline, FFmpeg orchestration, export rendering.
- **Transcriber worker** — loads Whisper/NLLB and runs inference off the main thread so the UI stays responsive.
- **FFmpeg worker** — extracts audio from the uploaded video before transcription.
- **Model downloads** — fetched from Hugging Face on first use (~150 MB for Whisper base + translation model). Progress is shown in the status dock; models can be cleared from the downloads panel.

### Browser capabilities

| Capability | Used for |
| --- | --- |
| WebGPU | Faster Whisper inference (when supported) |
| WebCodecs | Fast MP4 export with burned-in subtitles |
| SharedArrayBuffer / cross-origin isolation | Required by FFmpeg WASM in some environments |

## Deployment

The site is deployed as static assets on Cloudflare Workers. Configuration lives in `wrangler.jsonc`:

```sh
pnpm deploy
```

You need a [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and Wrangler authenticated (`wrangler login`).

## Adding a language

1. Add the locale code to `i18n.locales` in `astro.config.mjs`.
2. Create `src/pages/<code>/index.astro` (copy `src/pages/es/index.astro`).
3. Add a translation block in `src/i18n/ui.ts` mirroring the English keys.
4. Register the display name in `languages` inside `src/i18n/ui.ts`.

## Privacy

subvid.app is designed around local-first processing:

- Videos are read from disk via the File API — never uploaded.
- AI models run in Web Workers with WASM/WebGPU.
- No analytics backend or user accounts in this codebase.
